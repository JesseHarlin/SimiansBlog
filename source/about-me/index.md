#About Me

Hello! My name is Jesse. If you've made it here, you're probably wondering who I am. The short answer is that I am a professional software engineer, husband to [Amanda Harlin](http://amandaharlin.com/) and a software development [community leader](http://techlahoma.org/) in my area. If you're looking for the Jesse Harlin that likes syntesizers, writes music and thinks Javascript is cool - you're got the right guy.

My other interests include music composition; especially algorithmic music composition. Actually, I got started writing programs through music, by using tools like [Max/Msp](https://cycling74.com/products/max/) and [Supercollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/). You can hear a lot of my music on my [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/harlinjesse) if you're curious. I also like playing with Arduino, making video games and hanging out with Amanda.
