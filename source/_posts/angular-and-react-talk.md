# Angular with React.js

## About
I recently gave a talk at the local Javascript user group about my experiences with using Angular and React in a similar project. In some ways, this was a technical talk, covering various ways to integrate an external lib (React) properly into the context of a very differnt framework (Angular). However, much of the talk really centered around the role of abstraction in a project, and learning how to assess the tradeoffs of various tools one might adopt.
