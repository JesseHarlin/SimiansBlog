Tomorrow, my usergroup is going to have a talk I’m absolutely certain will be incredibly awesome. The guys at Goldfire Studios, James Simpson and Luke Simpkins,  are going to be running the show and talking about their recent creation “Casino RPG”.  It was featured recently on a kickstarter, that, along with many others,  my wife and I contributed to.
