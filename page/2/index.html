    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Occasionally I fond myself doing work in Adobe After Effects. One of the most common tasks I do, when compositing is have one of my clips loop indefinitely. This seriously beats the alternative: copy and paste hell.</p>
<p>Its really simple to do, and all you have to do is write one line of script.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to do it. I have a clip I’m working here, where I’m trying to simulate an old school NES password prompt.</p>
<img src="/images/loop_an_animation_in_aftereffects/ae1.png">
<p>See that Gold  Square up there? I need that to blink, repeatedly- like a cursor. Then, I need to move that around and a typing animation plays, and this leads the text as it comes in. The effect is as if a person is quickly entering a password. Its really kickass. Lets make the cursor.</p>
<p>I go into Photoshop, make a rectangle, add bevel and emboss  as a layer effect and voila: a cursor.</p>
<p>Cursor<br><img src="/images/loop_an_animation_in_aftereffects/ae2.png"></p>
<p>There is is. Bask in its majesty! A Cursor. Whooo!</p>
<p>Now, I take the cursor and add it to my After Effect’s project resources.</p>
<img src="/images/loop_an_animation_in_aftereffects/ae3.png">
<p>Wonderful. So far, so easy. Now I want it to flash. I make a new composition, and simply adjust the opacity, to make it fade out.</p>
<img src="/images/loop_an_animation_in_aftereffects/ae4.png">
<p>This composition is small – only 5 frames. this thing is going to flash quickly, like a password cursor prompt does. So, lets make it flash in my composition. This is a simple 3 step process.</p>
<img src="/images/loop_an_animation_in_aftereffects/ae5.png">
<p>Step one: Enable Time Remapping. After you drag your composition onto the track canvas, just right click and go to the time submenu and click it. It will be checked now, and then you’re ready for part two.</p>
<img src="/images/loop_an_animation_in_aftereffects/ae6.png">
<p>You select that Fancy new Time Remap row that just popped up under your composition, and Add Expression. Its under the Animation submenu. A new track will appear under the Time Remap, and you can click in the row, and type whatever you need to. You’re ready for step three: the script.</p>
<img src="/images/loop_an_animation_in_aftereffects/ae7.png">
<p>On the row, type this : loop_out(“cycle”, 0). Now the 5-frame loop I made will repeat over and over.  The cursor is blinking! I can now apply any normal compositing techniques from here.</p>
<p>This technique is insanely useful, I use it all the time. A flickering flame, a flashing led, a walking sprite… It can all be done with this easy trick.</p>

        <p>One of my favorite sound sets is the 8-bit retro sound palette that one gets from the sample channel of an old Nintendo. I have a tool I really enjoy using in my studio, and that is a Nintendo that has modified cartridge that acts as a midi controller in it. We’ve had some good times together. I’ve been using this thing, literally since the 90s and its been a frequent go-to toy in my arsenal. As some point along the way, I swapped out my bulkier TV screen I used with it for a smaller one, I mounted on the front. </p>
<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/168244021&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

<p>I’ve used it in a ton of musical tracks. A prominent one, was “God in my automatic Vacuum”, that I wrote nearly 9 years ago</p>
<img src="/images/battery_drumkit/nes_thumb.jpg">
<p>I’d like to keep using it and generally the melodic lines aren’t so problematic- but the percussion parts I tend to write choke this baby up quite fast. Do you remember when you were a kit, and the Ninendo would freeze up, and you and your friends would pull out the cartridge and ‘blow on it’. Yeah, I’m not sure why we did that. The trick was actually simply reseating the cartridge. What I am saying is that, imagine having to go through that ritual periodically as you are writing a piece of music. See folks this is why old gear has a MIDI panic button. On this? The Panic button is labeled ‘power’. that right, simply resetting the unit isn’t good enough; you also have to drain that flea power too. Seriously, it can get tedious.</p>
<img src="/images/battery_drumkit/8-Bit-NES-Cartridge-Blow-Me-Poster-Post-545x300_thumb_1.jpg">
<p>For those who know me, know that one of my favorite tools is Battery 3 by Native instruments. When it comes to working with percussion lines, especially in the context of electronic music, I consider it second to none. I’ve always wanted to make a battery kit of this thing. I clearly like it enough to keep it for a long time, so why not get it into the Virtual Instrument space? There is a clear theme, to this collection of sounds – and with Battery I can make multiple copies of my ‘8-bit’ drum set, run the individual cells through some awesome dsp, and generally have more control.</p>
<p>At this point, I am going to assume a very novice level of understanding of Battery 3 if you’re reading this. 128 sounds is the largest size of a patch Battery 3 can support (16 x 8). For me, at least ; this is what we want. There is no reason to make a smaller kit than this, we have 8 bit samples aplenty.</p>
<p>In battery you can use the + and – buttons in the corner of the matrix to add and remove columns.</p>
<img src="/images/battery_drumkit/bat_thumb.jpg">
<p>That’s nice and all, but the most efficient way is to click the edit dropdown and select the appropriate matrix size..in this case 16 x 8.</p>
<img src="/images/battery_drumkit/batttery-select-matrix_thumb.jpg">
<p>Now we need to get our samples. In my case, I am going to be using Digital Performer to capture them from the NES. I set up a MIDI track an aux and an audio track.</p>
<img src="/images/battery_drumkit/analog.png">
<p>I’ll explain why I’ve done this. The mono audio track is where I will actually be capturing the samples. The aux track is so that I can use inserts to clean up the samples on the way in. In this instance, the NES is a dirty , dirty little machine. Its noisy, glitch and in dire need of dynamics effects.</p>
<img src="/images/battery_drumkit/cells.png">
<p>The first item is the gate. Really the only point of this is to make the track actually silent when the samples aren’t playing. Next, is a preamp. This, I am using simply to sweeten the sound a bit. Directly from the NES the sample was a bit dull. This added a bit of compression and some punch on some of the bassier clips. The final unit is a multiband compressor, that I am using to tame some of the wilder samples. and bring up the quieter ones. Since the NES responds pretty differently depending on the frequency range, I used a 3 band multiband compressor. I had good results with that. The final effect you see above in the insert sequence was a Limiter. I found I really ended up not needing that after all, so its bypassed here.</p>
<p>The midi track is dead simple- its simply a chromatic scale that ascends, to fire each sample one after the other on the hardware unit.</p>
<p>Now? We capture. This admittedly took a few tries. 80s hardware likes to croak now and then, and occasionally I had it fire samples twice or thrice.</p>
<img src="/images/battery_drumkit/slices.png">
<p>See how frequently it croaks? Those dark bars are where it fires more often than It was supposed to. Don’t get me wrong- I really really like the unpredictability of it on some level, but for this I wanted to keep things a bit clean, relative to my usual workflow.</p>
<p>Now Lets make a place to save out kit, but first a little bit about battery kits.  Check out the folder structure below. As you can see, we can organize our kits by folder, and then the kit consists of a folder with a particular name, and then in that is a folder with the samples, and in the parent directory is the .kt3 file.</p>
<img src="/images/battery_drumkit/directory.png">
<p>This corresponds to this in the editor:</p>
<img src="/images/battery_drumkit/editor.png">
<p>This is handy because it makes it pretty easy to organize your kits. So, I’m going to essentially duplicate this kind of structure for my own kit. There will be a folder for samples and I will save the kit itself in the parent. So first I duplicate the folder structure.</p>
<img src="/images/battery_drumkit/directory2.png">
<p>Then, when I go back into battery  “Save As” and I choose the Nes Kit Samples for the sample Sub folder. Unfortunately when I did this, I got an error related to permissions.</p>
<img src="/images/battery_drumkit/directory3.png">
<p>The fix is simple. - just leave the chosen folder spot blank- let battery make the folder for you. Thanks Battery. After saving you have this:</p>
<img src="/images/battery_drumkit/directory4.png">
<p>So far, so good.</p>
<p>Ok honestly, this next part is the tedious bit. There might be some shortcut way of doing this, but I don’t know it.  It will involve exporting each sound, and naming it. Thank goodness this only happens once.</p>
<p>First Select the waveform, and make sure you also select the master track too. Bounce it to disk. I bounced as a 16-bit wav. That works fine.</p>
<img src="/images/battery_drumkit/bounce1.png">
<img src="/images/battery_drumkit/bounce2.png">
<p>Make sure you saved to the samples folder, it should appear in the folder now.</p>
<p>The final step-You drag the sample to the target cell you wish to map to. You can even drag a batch of samples, and they will map sequentially, one square after another.</p>
<img src="/images/battery_drumkit/just_drag.jpg">
<p>Boom just drag. Here is my amazing kit with ONE whole sample! Now I’m going to do this for all the others. As I go thorough he waveforms I intend to audition each one, normalize it and then bounce it. Name them as best you can.</p>
<p>It’s the same repetitive process over and over. Snip out the waveform, then I was using the Mono Trim Plugin to normalize and audition simultaneously. Honestly, naming these things is the hardest. Ever think about how many adjective you really have to describe a bass drum? Less than you think.</p>
<p>That’s it for part one. Next time I am going to cover how to make multiple kits form the sample set, and what, in my opinion constitutes a good kit. Truthfully, one sample set can yield a lot of versatility, and with a few tricks you can make you kits sound absolutely awesome with Battery.</p>

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Recently I was working on a short project, and I was in need of monitoring my input audio as it was being passed thorough my inserts. As you know the later versions of Digital Performer (in this case 7.24) have a really useful column you may have noticed: the “Mon” column next to the input column in the tacks view of the sequencer.</p>
<p>That’s the column there, with the lighted speaker icon. Now you can hear the input as you send your midi sequence.</p>
<img src="/images/quick_fix_monitoring_audio_digital_performer/tracks.png">
<p>However I ran into a problem. Usually when I’m recording a certain persnickety external module – and by that I mean my MIDI enabled NES. I need to run the incoming audio through a little bit of dynamic effects. For one, the Nes emmits a terrible 60hz hum, and is generally noisy. I don’t mind this so much on the actual percussive impulses of the notes – it adds..er… flavor (read: 8-bit trash ). the problem is when the instrument should be tacet it makes a hum.</p>
<p>The point of this, is that I needed to be able to monitor the affect signal. I tried my usual trick of running through an aux..but.. it wasn’t working! Why?</p>
<p>The stranger part of it all,w as that it worked wonderfully with virtual instruments. And I said to myself “Bro, do you even know how to Aux/bus?”</p>
<p>Then I found the answer. It was in a strange location, so hence the post – After messing with the Audio Patch through, Audio Monitor, Settings and a host of other settings, the answer was right up in the menu.</p>
<img src="/images/quick_fix_monitoring_audio_digital_performer/setup.png">
<p>In the Configure Audio System fly out, there is an option for Input Monitoring Mode. Select that.</p>
<p>Then, allow Monitor record-enabled tracks through effects.</p>
<img src="/images/quick_fix_monitoring_audio_digital_performer/input.png">
<p>I don’t know about you, but I found this setting to be in sort of an unusual place. I think I initially predicted its location to be in the Bundles menu, but I suppose that’s not an optimal spot eiter.</p>
<p>In any case, that’s the fix.</p>

        <p>Occasionally someone taps my should to ask a quick javascript question. I figure that if someone is asking, its probably worth writing a quick blog post about. This post is geared to someone that is more or less newer to frontend stuff, and is looking for a few tips to help them out.</p>
<p>The question was: I have a list of 12 items, in a ul. I’d like to split it in half, and make two seperate lists. How can I do this?</p>
<p>Actually, this seemingly straightforward question is a good chance to talk about a few things.</p>
<p>Foremost:  the code is pretty straightforward if you do this in jQuery. First, here is the jQuery way: </p>

<p>So far, so good. Notice the first statement is simply to target a desired ul. the next bit uses an interesting jQuery pseudoselector: gt. This of course stands for ‘greater than’ and takes an index. since our list is 12 items, and index of 5 is exactly halfway in, since its 0 indexed. Its counterpart is lt, which is ‘less than’.</p>
<p>Now, at this point, I always suggest pulling something off the DOM, working ‘in memory’ and then doing a single DOM resinsertion. Get in the practice of thinking like this. Working directly on the DOM is slow-sauce, and you don’t want to go there. So, we use .remove(). Notice the selection itself is cached in our variable $last6lis. I should add that I personally always preface a jQuery variable with $. This is a way of keeping your jQuery DOM pieces separated from plain old javascript ‘data’.</p>
<p>Then we make a ‘ul’ tag in memory, pop our list items in that, and push it back onto the DOM, directly after our targetd item.</p>
<p>And all is right in the world.</p>
<p>Only… we can do just a tiny bit more. </p>
<p>first of all, while the lt and gt selectors are certainly great, the <code>.splice()</code> function is technically faster, and in my opinion more clear. Recall that jQuery selectors, are really lists of jQuery objects. Actually, if you can internalize that with jQuery its ‘always’ a list - that makes life easier. </p>
<p>So lets try a quick experiment: first lets ditch the :gt selector and replace it with <code>splice()</code>. That means we need indexes 6-11, so we’d write something like: </p>
<p><code>$ul.find(&#39;li&#39;).splice(6,11)</code> instead of <code>$ul.find(&#39;li:gt(5)&#39;)</code></p>
<p>That’s cool and all, but if you drop that directly in the fiddle.. it totally doesnt work! Why?</p>
<p>Simple answer: remember earlier that jQuery selectors always return a list of jQuery objects! what does splice return?  Just a primitive array.  The fix: Just wrap the result of the splice in a new jQuery function, and you’re back in action, rockin’ the suburbs.</p>
<p><code>$($ul.find(&#39;li&#39;).splice(6,11))</code>  .. like this.</p>
<p>Well, this is cool! now we can even change these numbers around, and select different segments of the initial list. Now, what if we wanted to refactor and make something that would always split our list in half, regardless of length? The answer is much more clear now, you could do something a bit like this:</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/the_Simian/GgXXL/embedded/js,resources,html,css,result/light" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Neat! now no matter what the length our li’s grow to be, we can always bisect them! Anytime you can do a small amount of work to make your code not require as much updating, that is handy.  Of course taking this to the next level, would be to pull this code out and put it in a function, or a plugin and begin to make it truly reuseable, but for now, for a quick ‘document ready’ script - this is fine.</p>

        <p>I decided to make a quick post detailing how to connect Orchard CMS with Live Writer. There are a number of advantages to using LiveWriter, rather than the HTML editor on the remote blog. For one, you can work offline, which might be handy now and then if you’re in a situation where you don’t have a decent internet connection. A second advantage is the fact that you can keep a local backup of all your posts. I don’t recommend this being your only backup, of course- but hey a little replication doesn’t hurt. Of course my favorite reason is to make use of the superior editor and plugins. Really, the editor is nice. It feels like Word with spell check and such, but you can also go into the source view and make sure everything is clean. It doesn’t inject a bunch of junk into your markup either.</p>
<p>Ok, so the first thing to make sure of, is that you actually have Live Writer already installed. In my case I did, because it came with the Windows Live suite, but if you don’t : Here is the link to get it.</p>
<p>Now lets assume you’ve already deployed Orchard on your server, or into the cloud or however you wish to do it. I started Live Writer and was Immediately prompted with this:</p>
<img src="/images/orchard_and_livewriter/choose-blog-service-orchard-livewriter_thumb.jpg">
<p>Make sure you pick the last option: Other Services. Now you’ll be prompted to fill our your blog information:</p>
<img src="/images/orchard_and_livewriter/orchad-and-livewriter-fill-out-settings_thumb.jpg">
<p>This part may give you some trouble if you’re not sure what to type, so I’ll be clear here. The address is not for the address of your root Orchard installation(your homepage) , but for the blog itself. Orchard is capable of hosting many blogs per orchard site, you see. If you are using Orchard though, for just one blog – that blog may very well be your homepage in that case. For me, my blog wasn’t my homepage at all – it was somewhere else. As for the Username and password, that is the user that will be posting. The user needs permissions to post of course. Then type that user’s password in. This might be your admin name, it may not- but either way the user needs to exist on the Orchard site and needs to be able to make blog posts.</p>
<p>So everything is good … you click next and</p>
<img src="/images/orchard_and_livewriter/orchard-and-livewriter-mess-up_thumb.jpg">
<p>Whoops. If you saw this, then something went wrong. The most likely culprit is that your Orchard installation did not have remote publishing enabled. No problemo, that’s an easy fix.</p>
<img src="/images/orchard_and_livewriter/orchard-and-livewriter-enable-remote_thumb.jpg">
<p>I logged in, and went to the modules section in the Dashboard of my site. You can search for the module, and enable it. In case you’re curious, this all works by Xml-RPC. That’s “eXtended Markup Language Remote Procedure Call”, for what its worth. If you’re really curious, Orchard has some documentation about it. Try connecting again, just hit the back button and then re run it.</p>
<p>If things go well, you get a different window, after Live Writer Discovers your blog.</p>
<img src="/images/orchard_and_livewriter/orchard-and-livewriter_thumb.jpg">
<p>Basically, Live Writer is attempting to discover your blog’s theme in order to make the blog preview. go ahead and select ‘Yes’. In my case, the preview wasn’t perfect – some of the formatting wasn’t quite right, but it was useful enough to help give me an idea.</p>
