        <p>You can bet I have a massive Gruntfile to rework. Every journey begins with the smallest step.</p>
<p>First we do the node dance. Install Gulp!</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">npm install -g gulp</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>And then:</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">npm install --save-dev gulp</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Now I add a gulpfile.js to my project, and </p>
<figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> gulp = <span class="built_in">require</span>(<span class="string">'gulp'</span>);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>so far, so simple.</p>
<p>now I actually need STUFF. Gulp plugins. Thankfully here is many. I just follwoed the same procedure for each</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">npm install --save-dev gulp-changed</span><br><span class="line">npm install --save-dev gulp-concat</span><br><span class="line">npm install --save-dev gulp-copy</span><br><span class="line">npm install --save-dev gulp-stylus</span><br><span class="line">npm install --save-dev gulp-clean</span><br><span class="line">npm install --save-dev gulp-htmlmin</span><br><span class="line">npm install --save-dev gulp-cssmin</span><br><span class="line">npm install --save-dev gulp-uglify</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>If you used it in Grunt, most likely it is also in gulp. Notice I didnt add watch? That’s already included in gulp. Awesome!</p>
<p>Now one little thing you can do is explicitly include each plugin. That is well and good. Actually, if you start breaking your files up for organizational reasons (protip: we will) that’s the way to go. If you have a shorter gulpfile.js, or just want to include everythign easily, heres a little trick</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">npm install --save-dev matchdep</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

Autoloads every gulp plugin, since they are conventionally named. Globbing is neato!</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Again, this is more practical, if you're going to stick to one file. </span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Now here is what is interesting. I'm immediately seeing pros to Gulp. I'll set up a simple script that goes into a series of theme folders, and makes basically a series of theme stylesheets. </span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">In grunt I have a function declared somewhere in my options object that I use throughout the file. I had to do it like this because Grunt is massively configuration-heavy.;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Its someting like this:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">```js</span><br><span class="line">options.themeList = function themeList(themes) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">            var obj = &#123;&#125;;</span><br><span class="line">            for (var i = 0, ii = themes.length; i &lt; ii; i++) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">                var root = 'src/public/styles/themes/' + themes[i];</span><br><span class="line">                obj[root + '/theme.css'] = root + '/theme.styl';</span><br><span class="line">            &#125;</span><br><span class="line">            return obj;</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>and somewhere I have a list of themes corresponding to folders, in my case I have 9 total. Lets pretend these are also attached to my session grunt options object. Basically:</p>
<figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">options.themes = [</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="string">'ThemeOne'</span>,</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="string">'ThemeTwo'</span>,</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="string">'ThemeThree'</span>,</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="string">'ThemeFour'</span>,</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="string">'ThemeFive'</span>,</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="string">'ThemeSix'</span>,</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="string">'ThemeSeven'</span>,</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="string">'ThemeEight'</span>,</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="string">'ThemeNine'</span></span><br><span class="line">    ]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>And then, this is used in the stylus plugin for Grunt, in the Gruntfile.js</p>
<figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">//...</span></span><br><span class="line">stylus: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">         themes: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">             options: &#123;use: [<span class="built_in">require</span>(<span class="string">'nib'</span>)]&#125; <span class="comment">//some stylus options</span></span><br><span class="line">             files: options.themeList (options.themes)</span><br><span class="line">         &#125;</span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">//...</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>There are probably simpler, and more elegant ways to do this. Actually, in my actual code there are some minor varitions from this, taht are related to implementation, but this should get the point across, easily. Grunt’s initConfig Method is a big, honkin pile of JSON. Actually, in practice mine had gotton so large that I was looking at strategies to organize it when I stumbled upon Gulp.</p>
<p>I wrote a similar setup in Gulp. I was able to encapsulate the method much more nicely, because Gulp is code-first! Its something like this:</p>
<figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">gulp.task(<span class="string">'stylus:themes'</span>, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">stylusThemes</span><span class="params">()</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">var</span> themes = options.themes;</span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">makeThemes</span><span class="params">(themes)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">var</span> i = <span class="number">0</span>, ii = themes.length; i &lt; ii; i++) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="keyword">var</span> theme = themes[i],</span><br><span class="line">                themeFolder = <span class="string">'src/public/styles/themes/'</span> + theme,</span><br><span class="line">                stylusConfig = &#123;</span><br><span class="line">                    use: [<span class="string">'nib'</span>]</span><br><span class="line">                &#125;;</span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line">            gulp</span><br><span class="line">                .src(themeFolder + <span class="string">'/theme.styl'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">                .pipe(stylus(stylusConfig))</span><br><span class="line">                .pipe(gulp.dest(themeFolder));</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line">    makeThemes(themes); </span><br><span class="line">&#125;);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>As a side note, I can’t help but reflect upon some of the same organizational issues I encountered whilst working in say, Ext.js. There you have another, really big, configur-ish way to implement a module pattern. Its nice, but when you need to go outside the box, it can be challenging at a glance to figure out where stuff should live. I think theres a very reasonably attraction to tools like node and browserfy, and other very code-first approaches to code organization. I mentioned this in the last post, but in C# land, using more convention over configuration has proven time and time again to be a better way of doing things. I pity the dev using XML instead of FLuent nHibernate to configure nHibernate. It really is much better.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. a Very very slightly not run-of-the mill task cross written on both platforms. To my eyes, the Gulp version is way more maintainable in the long run. However, the story doesn’t end there. I ran the two side by side, just out of curiosity, to see which one is faster. Now, recall, these are pretty big tasks here. These aren’t fired at request time from a client, but are preprocessed to make static resources. The only thing that truly benefits is like a file watch while working in the .stylus files. But, omigosh Gulp is faster.</p>
<p>Here is the Grunt task ( I am using time-grunt to measure the speed):</p>
<img src="/images/gulp/grunt-stylus-speed.png">
<p>Theme names have been hidden to protect the innocent. Just pretend they are named after American Presidents. eg. FranklinPierce\theme.css </p>
<p>Now, here is the same thing in Gulp.</p>
<img src="/images/gulp/gulp-stylus.png">
<p>I had to run it twice to be sure. Did it actually make the files? I looked. Yes, they’re there. That’s literally over 1000 times faster. 1064.891 times faster, to be more accurate.</p>
<p>Wow. I expect huge gains during tasks that run under file watch during development.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I use a lot of operating systems. Regularly, I use Windows, OSX and Linux. It seems like at work, unless I’m doing somethig with virtual machines, I’m typically on Windows. Now, I am not a fanboy of any particular OS. I believe they all have strengths and weaknesses, and I find I use them differntly, for differnt tasks. One very admitable shortcoming in Windows, is most certainly its console. It Just Sucks™.</p>
<p>Now if you work in git, you might have installed, at some point, for windows the bash console emulator, Msys Git. Its nice, but not perfect. If you do any node development, you probably have many, many consoles open. Some are bash, some are standard windows. It gets annoying.</p>
<p>Lately I’ve been using Conemu. Its honestly fantastic, and frequently updated. And really resolved the issue of working between worlds. I did a few things to get it set up like I like.</p>
<p>One of my favorite things about the Git console is, admittedly this little feature:</p>
<img src="/images/you_need_a_better_console/Git-Bash-Here.png">
<p>uch a little thing, makes a big differnce.</p>
<p>In conemu, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the settings. Either ightclick and select fromt he menu or Win+ Alt + P. Whatever.</li>
</ol>
<img src="/images/you_need_a_better_console/conemu1.png">
<ol>
<li>Go to integration. Make sure the “Conmemu Here” is there, and the command looks correct. Should say someting like “smd -cur_console:n”</li>
</ol>
<img src="/images/you_need_a_better_console/conemu2.png">
<ol>
<li><p>Click Register.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Magic</p>
</li>
</ol>
<img src="/images/you_need_a_better_console/conemu3.png">
<p>You can also do cool stuff like automatically open Conemu with certain tabs open, use differnt themes and a lot of other stuff.</p>

        <p>Observation: Quality Javascript taskrunners tend to be named after gutteral noises. Fascinating.</p>
<p>I guess lately I’ve been having a sort of love afair with Gulp. Its interesting, considering I actually adopted Grunt fairly recently, just last year. ( I know, I’m late to the party). I picked it up when Grunt 0.4 Came along. I remember it was much nicer than the previous version. Everything was a plugin (rather than builtin), and it made sense to me. Grunt rocked, and still rocks my world. Its so very easy. Theres really only three things you need to know: To pull in the plugins, to configure them declaratively, and to make tasks. Then, you run them. Simple. </p>
<p>The big thing with grunt, I’ve noticed whilst working with it, is that the declarative JSON…mammoth.. gets pretty big after a while. I’m aware there are strategies for refactoring and organizing your Gruntfiles, i just feel like I often can’t bring myself to find time to just sit and simply refactor my Grunt tasks. So lately, at the shop, we’ve been working on a scaffolding project to help us get up and running on future applications more rapidly. Now is my golden chance to refactor Grunt.. or?</p>
<p>Gulp? Should I explore this as a viable option? Why not?</p>
<p>These tools clearly compete for the exact same ‘job’ in my toolbox. One works off of configuration, the other uses streams; its sort of ‘code-first’. I like that.  I am reminded of when I switched to fluent nHibernate configuration years ago, rather than xml configuration. It really made everything easier to read and compose. Maybe I could achieve similar benefits here. It seems equally simple. Theres four main things, ‘task, watch, src, dest’. That’s really all. Also the modules seem smaller, and the concerns of each seem more seperate. And the most interesting part, is that the tasks seem to run as concurrently as possible. That, plus the fact they are essentialyl streams could result in much faster execution times. I suppose that isn’t as big a deal when you’re doing a preprocessing task, but during a file watch it can be really handy. It can also be handy if there are tasks related to CI.</p>
<p>OK, let’s play.</p>

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Orchard is generally easy to setup. I think there is a larger question about workflow and deployment one has when they’re asking about setup. Really there’s two kinds of people interested in setting up Orchard. For lack of better terminology, I’ll say its either an end-user or a developer. We will be working , as a developer, off of the Orchard Source, but for the sake of completeness I’ll mention how to set up the built version also,as if you were an end-user.</p>
<p>Prebuilt Setup</p>
<p>I’m mentioning this here, because this is what you’ll find most often out there on the web. Want to get started in Orchard? Just go get Webmatrix and click install for orchard! Its important to understand what you’re installing here! You’re installing a build of Orchard. This is the small ready-to-deploy version. This is not what you want if you are interested in building modules yourself. This is for absolutely minimal resistance in setup. </p>
<p>First get <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/" target="_blank" rel="external">Webmatrix</a>. Its already on version 3! This is really amazing to me. It was just released in 2011, and its made so much progress. Version 2 was out just last September. This particular tool is moving at breakneck speed, and its free.</p>
<p>So once you have Webmatrix, and you’re ready to make a site you go to the App Gallery (formerly Web Gallery).</p>
<img src="/images/orchard/orchard1.png">
<p>Then, you click on the Orchard CMS Button.</p>
<img src="/images/orchard/orchard2.png">
<p>Easy. Click Next a few times, and the installer literally does all the rest.</p>
<img src="/images/orchard/orchard3.png">
<p>Couldn’t be easier, right?</p>
<p>Within seconds of the bar completing, you click OK, and you’ll be prompted in Webmatrix with a folder structure sort of like this:</p>
<img src="/images/orchard/orchard4.png">
<p>More on that later…</p>
<p>And a big giant prompt like this:</p>
<img src="/images/orchard/orchard5.png">
<p>Go ahead and fill this out, you site name and what you want the superuser account to be. Just select Default for the Orchard Recipe. Select SQL Server Compact for data storage.</p>
<p>Now you have a site. Cool! At this point, you’d start configuring it like you need to, possibly install a module or two form the gallery. Probably install a different theme, and so on. Even though this is the non-source setup, you do have some latitude in configuring the project, you can alter the html on the views, namely and possibly fiddle around with some CSS. Don’t expect to do heavy development here though, that’s not what this workflow is really for.</p>
<p>Look at the folder structure for a moment. You are looking at what in the source will be the Orchard.Web project – one of 67 or so projects. You’ll notice that in this built project, you have every module listed in your module folder. It will be like this in the source too, though in Visual Studio you’ll see an aliased folder. Every image you add, and every piece of media you upload ends up, some way in the Media Folder.  Every theme you make or download ends up in the theme folder.  Its generally quite organized.</p>
<p>I want to draw attention to one very important folder: App_Data. Open that. Now drill down Sites –&gt; Default. Look in there. see the Orchard.sdf file? That’s your site. Basically.</p>
<img src="/images/orchard/orchard6.png">
<p>If your site gets completely blown away, you can reinstall it all, and drop that in and all your blog posts, and content will be back. I hope this makes it clear how easy it is to back up an Orchard site, you just really need to account for the Media folder, because it has all your pictures and stuff, and this folder in your Sites.</p>
<p>So at this point, you can put this Orchard install on your server, or push it to Azure or whatever you like. Boom, you installed Orchard. Beyond that its up to you. You might like simply editing posts in the online editor, or you might set up Live Writer to edit them. I’ve written about how to set up Live Writer in the past. Its not hard, and it works well. The bottom line is that I can’t stress the importance of your Media Sites –&gt; Default folders.  Back these up.</p>
<p>Recently, my wife’s blog was spammed to the max. Eventually the attackers were able to bring down the blog. A similar situation in Wordpress or some other system would have really bothered me, but with her we simply backed up the imporant folders, then pulled our personal Orchard build from github, replacing everything. Then? We replaced the Media and Sites—&gt; Default folders.  It was a complete recovery.</p>
<p>Next though, we need to get setup from the source. I’m gearing these tutorials to be used in Visual Studio. Honestly, if you’re a c# developer that’s the way to go. you get all the advantages of your favorite IDE, such as Resharper – and also you can build the project.</p>
<p>We’ll cover that next.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Now that you understand how you can start straight away from an already built project (what Webmatrix provides), I think its best at this point to work henceforth directly from the source. There are a number of reasons for this. First of all, there’s not layer of abstraction for you. Starting from the build is great, but there’s a lot of advantages to being able to start form the source, and build it yourself. This gets you in the game. Sometimes , for example there is an older version of a module in the gallery, and you want the latest one, which is available on the modules site. Maybe the way to make a module work, is just a simple fix, and would be easy if you could see the source. In fact, on the subject of modules, the source has many “must have” modules already included in the source drop, such as Tag Cloud, Lucene, Search and others. The built version you can download has been slimmed down for size. This isn’t an issue for use, since we will build ourselves. Since theres a lot already included, this helps you configure very quickly. Maybe you want to make your own module. Seriously, working from the source is the way to go. Plus, most importantly, its much more comfortable to work in Visual Studio. You know your personal arsenal of plugins is working fine, when everything builds and runs, and when you can run all your tests.</p>
<p>There’s a number of ways to acquire the source. If you go to the Orchard project site, they are going to basically walk you through setting up Mercurial, and pulling the source down that way. You don’t necessarily have to do this. Clearly, I recommend using some manner of source control- and if you want to hang with the Orchard team you need to use Hg. That’s well and fine but I’m really into Github, so that’s what I use. If this is what you want to do, just go download the source from codeplex and then start your own repo. From here on out, this will be the main tool that powers all your orchard sites. When you build you can just include and exclude from this. If a site gets messed up, you can make a quick build and override the files. This source won’t overwrite your Media and Site folders; in fact- I put those folders in my .gitignore file. Whatever works for you in terms of deployment and source control is what you should do.</p>
<p>I will add that I keep my personal clone of the orchard source on my local dev machine. Orchard is actually pretty big – well the source is. I suppose that’s a side effect of having so many projects and so much modularity.</p>
<p>Go ahead and explore the Source drop. It should look like the image below (more or less) There’s some things to note here.</p>
<img src="/images/orchard/orchard7.png">
<p>First off there’s a ton of .hg files like hg tags and so on. This is all just stuff Mercurial uses. (Hg is the periodic table abbreviation for Mercury – get it? har har.) Neat.</p>
<p>There is a lib folder. A bunch of third party libraries live there. Orchard uses them. What libraries? Autofac, Clay, Castle Windsor, Nuget, Lucene, Log4Net, jQuery, nHibernate and stuff like that. Basically a ton of flippin’ awesome open source tools you should probably learn about anyways.  Honestly seeing this lib folder was a huge step in helping me decide to adopt Orchard as a core tool in my toolbelt. The Orchard team- they have taste!</p>
<p>Then, of course there are a few .cmd files. These are scripts we utilize to build. Can you guess what the file ClickToBuild does? You probably guessed correctly. It takes this Orchard source, and generates a built project we can use to deploy. It also runs your tests for you. I should mention that you can <em>technically</em> put the source on your server, and it will work. Its also a massive waste of disk space. Don’t do it.</p>
<p>Then finally there is the orchard src itself. Take a good look at how this entire source is laid out. This is par for the course how a good project should be laid out. The source has its own folder, and the parent folder has a lot of ‘meta’ stuff related to the source.</p>
<p>Now look in the source itself, and then open Orchard.Web.</p>
<img src="/images/orchard/orchard8.png">
<p>Look familiar? it’s the same folder structure we saw from the Webmatrix project we got from the Web Platform installer. I’m pointing this out, because this is basically going to be the part that gets deployed, after the build, with some exception. I’ll explain Look in the Modules in this directory.</p>
<img src="/images/orchard/orchard9.png">
<p>Each one of these modules is an entirely separate self contained project. Each has its own code, dependencies, models, controllers – everything. During the build, each module’s dependencies are reduced down, otherwise the final build would be really really big.</p>
<p>Now for the fun part, go back to the src folder and find the .sln file. That’s what Visual Studio Uses. First, hit the collapse all button. You’ll thank me later. Orchard is made up of a ton of smaller projects, one for each of those modules we saw, and of course the core and orchard.web itself. check out the solution explorer.</p>
<img src="/images/orchard/orchard10.png">
<p>There’s only a few projects in the root. the most important ones are Core and Web. Remember when we explored Orchard.Web earlier in the actual windows File explorer? Modules was inside of Orchard.Web. Here it appears outside, and at the top. That is, in fact the exact same folder. Now if you open in VS2010, it becomes more obvious. The folder looks like its opacity has been lowered, as if it’s a ghost folder. Nonetheless, that’s just an alias to the folder in Orchard.Web. Its listed atop for convenience, I assume.  Same case for Specs,Tests, Themes and Tools. Themes, for example is like Modules. The folder actually resides in the startup project, Orchard.Web.</p>
<p>I’m just pointing this out, because at first it confused me. Then I realized how handy that actually was.</p>
<p>So to rehash, these folders are all really located elsewhere:</p>
<p>Modules – Actually is located in Orchard.Web and is literally every extra module you’ve downloaded or added to Orchard, as well as the ones that were already there. This thing is big.<br>Specs + Tests  - These are for unit testing, integrations tests and that sort of thing..<br>Themes – All you themes go here. This is the last stop for overriding the appearance of Orchard. The folder really lives in Orchard.Web<br>Tools – This has testing helpers, and the orchard command line. More on this later.<br>I think more project exploration is in order, and also covering the sparkle magic that is the orchard command line environment. But that is for another day!</p>

    </h1>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Occasionally I fond myself doing work in Adobe After Effects. One of the most common tasks I do, when compositing is have one of my clips loop indefinitely. This seriously beats the alternative: copy and paste hell.</p>
<p>Its really simple to do, and all you have to do is write one line of script.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to do it. I have a clip I’m working here, where I’m trying to simulate an old school NES password prompt.</p>
<img src="/images/loop_an_animation_in_aftereffects/ae1.png">
<p>See that Gold  Square up there? I need that to blink, repeatedly- like a cursor. Then, I need to move that around and a typing animation plays, and this leads the text as it comes in. The effect is as if a person is quickly entering a password. Its really kickass. Lets make the cursor.</p>
<p>I go into Photoshop, make a rectangle, add bevel and emboss  as a layer effect and voila: a cursor.</p>
<p>Cursor<br><img src="/images/loop_an_animation_in_aftereffects/ae2.png"></p>
<p>There is is. Bask in its majesty! A Cursor. Whooo!</p>
<p>Now, I take the cursor and add it to my After Effect’s project resources.</p>
<img src="/images/loop_an_animation_in_aftereffects/ae3.png">
<p>Wonderful. So far, so easy. Now I want it to flash. I make a new composition, and simply adjust the opacity, to make it fade out.</p>
<img src="/images/loop_an_animation_in_aftereffects/ae4.png">
<p>This composition is small – only 5 frames. this thing is going to flash quickly, like a password cursor prompt does. So, lets make it flash in my composition. This is a simple 3 step process.</p>
<img src="/images/loop_an_animation_in_aftereffects/ae5.png">
<p>Step one: Enable Time Remapping. After you drag your composition onto the track canvas, just right click and go to the time submenu and click it. It will be checked now, and then you’re ready for part two.</p>
<img src="/images/loop_an_animation_in_aftereffects/ae6.png">
<p>You select that Fancy new Time Remap row that just popped up under your composition, and Add Expression. Its under the Animation submenu. A new track will appear under the Time Remap, and you can click in the row, and type whatever you need to. You’re ready for step three: the script.</p>
<img src="/images/loop_an_animation_in_aftereffects/ae7.png">
<p>On the row, type this : loop_out(“cycle”, 0). Now the 5-frame loop I made will repeat over and over.  The cursor is blinking! I can now apply any normal compositing techniques from here.</p>
<p>This technique is insanely useful, I use it all the time. A flickering flame, a flashing led, a walking sprite… It can all be done with this easy trick.</p>
